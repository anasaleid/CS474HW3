        On 3, allow the user to modify an existing group. Ask the user which group they wish to modify. Then ask
        whether they are trying to add or remove members to/from the group. Then, interactively allow the user to add

        or remove as many users as they want by offering a list of available choices and having the user select which
        member to interact with.
